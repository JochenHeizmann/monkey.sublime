## Mac OS X

### Installation

Please check that the download is named `monkey.sublime` and not something else. You may have to rename it.

Unzip to:

	~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text/Packages/

Next, you will need to add your monkey/bin folder to your system wide path. This is currently a bit awkward but will hopefully become easier as Sublime Text continues to be improved.

### Path
You will first need to confirm your monkey/bin location is in your shell path:

    echo "export PATH=\$PATH:/user/folder/monkey/bin" >> ~/.profile

Next, add the shell path to the system-wide environment:

    defaults write ${HOME}/.MacOSX/environment PATH "${PATH}"

Alternatively, you can manually edit `~/.MacOSX/environment.plist` or use the  [RCEnvironment](http://www.rubicode.com/Software/RCEnvironment/) preference pane. Either way, the goal is to add your monkey/bin path to the PATH variable in your environment.

You will need to restart for the changes to take effect.

## Windows

Support for Microsoft Windows is present. You will need to add your monkey/bin folder to the system PATH.

## Linux

There is currently no Linux support as Monkey does not currently support it.

## Support
